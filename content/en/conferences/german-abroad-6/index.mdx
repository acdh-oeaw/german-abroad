The sixth edition of German Abroad “German Worldwide: Diversity and Vitality” will take place in Porto Alegre, Brazil, from October 1 to 4, 2025.

In this edition on Brazilian soil, which is also inspired by the celebration of the bicentennial of German-speaking immigration in Brazil in 2024, we want to welcome colleagues from all continents to discuss relevant topics and share cultural experiences. The main theme “German Worldwide: Diversity and Vitality” signals a thematic expansion. In addition to linguistically focused topics, we also welcome proposals that address the interface between linguistics and related fields such as didactics, translation, history and literature.

Contributions are therefore invited on the following topics:

* Multilingualism and language contact
* Variation and language change
* language preservation
* language policy
* Language and culture
* Language and religion
* German-language press and media
* German-language teaching
* Literature of German-speaking migration movements
* Language and migration history
* Grammar and language description
* Lexicon Cognition and acquisition of minority languages
* Linguistic landscape
* Language translation



Abstracts for presentations or posters of max. 300 words can be submitted **by March 15, 2025** by e-mail to [germanabroad6@gmail.com](germanabroad6@gmail.com), stating the authors, institution, modality (presentation or poster) as well as the topic area. The conference languages are German and Portuguese. **Notification of acceptance** will be sent **by April 15, 2025**.

With this conference, we want to focus on the entire range of extraterritorial varieties of German, i.e. contributions on German on all five continents are very welcome. In particular, the conference aims to encourage a comparison of different language minority situations, to reflect on comparative research on corresponding contact situations and to contribute to the networking of research initiatives in this field.
