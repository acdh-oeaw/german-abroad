The sixth edition of German Abroad “German Worldwide: Diversity and Vitality” will take place in Porto Alegre, Brazil, from October 1 to 4, 2025.

In this edition on Brazilian soil, which is also inspired by the celebration of the bicentennial of German-speaking immigration in Brazil in 2024, we want to welcome colleagues from all continents to discuss relevant topics and share cultural experiences. The main theme “German Worldwide: Diversity and Vitality” signals a thematic expansion. In addition to linguistically focused topics, we also welcome proposals that address the interface between linguistics and related fields such as didactics, translation, history and literature.

Contributions are therefore invited on the following topics:

* Multilingualism and language contact
* Variation and language change
* language preservation
* language policy
* Language and culture
* Language and religion
* German-language press and media
* German-language teaching
* Literature of German-speaking migration movements
* Language and migration history
* Grammar and language description
* Lexicon Cognition and acquisition of minority languages
* Linguistic landscape
* Language translation

The official languages of the conference are German and Portuguese.

We look forward to welcoming you!

Yours sincerely, Your organizing committee
