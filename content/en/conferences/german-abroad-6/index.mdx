**Call for Papers** (<DownloadLink file="/assets/content/en/conferences/german-abroad-6/call-for-papers-german-abroad-6-portugiesisch.pdf">Portuguese version</DownloadLink>):

The sixth edition of the German Abroad conferences, which have so far taken place in Vienna (2014), Austin (2016), Erfurt (2018), Windhoek (2021) and Eichstätt/Munich (2023), will be held in **Porto Alegre, Brazil, from October 1 to 3, 2025**. An excursion to the German-speaking region is then planned for **October 4, 2025 (Saturday)**.

The conference will focus on special features of German-speaking language minorities. The focus will be on language contact situations and phenomena as well as the underlying communicative practices and socio-cultural factors.

Abstracts for presentations or posters of max. 300 words can be submitted **by March 15, 2025** by e-mail to [germanabroad6@gmail.com](germanabroad6@gmail.com), stating the authors, institution, modality (presentation or poster) as well as the topic area. The conference languages are German and Portuguese. **Notification of acceptance** will be sent **by April 15, 2025**.

With this conference, we want to focus on the entire range of extraterritorial varieties of German, i.e. contributions on German on all five continents are very welcome. In particular, the conference aims to encourage a comparison of different language minority situations, to reflect on comparative research on corresponding contact situations and to contribute to the networking of research initiatives in this field.
