## Perspectives from Variationist Sociolinguistics, Language Contact, and Multilingualism

The fourth German Abroad Conference took place online only on 28.9.2021 due to the pandemic and was organized by the Department of Humanities and Arts at the University of Namibia.  As the different origins of the participants – there were contributions from Germany, Poland, Texas, the Netherlands, Italy, Papua New Guinea and Namibia – would have resulted in major time differences, the presentations were recorded in advance and were reviewed and discussed on the day of the conference.

To give participants an impression of Namibia despite the digital format, the scientific presentations were supplemented by video presentations on Namibia, which were made available by the Gondwana Collection. A video of the University of Namibia choir provided a musical finale to the conference.
