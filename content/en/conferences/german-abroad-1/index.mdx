## Variationist, language contact, and multilinguism research perspectives

The first German Abroad Conference took place from July 4 to 5, 2014 at the Department of German Studies at the University of Vienna. The conference focused on the systemic and sociolinguistic characteristics of German-speaking language minorities from the perspectives of variationist linguistics, language contact and multilingualism research. One focus was on language minorities in North and South America, but other (language) contact situations were also considered.

More detailed information on the conference can be found on the [conference website](https://germanabroad2014.univie.ac.at/en/home/index.htm).
