... joined the [linguistics department](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/research-units/linguistics) (formerly Variation and Change of German in Austria) at the ACDH-CH (then ACDH) in December 2016. As group leader and editor of the [Dictionary of Historical Bavarian Dialects in Austria and South Tyrol](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/projects/wboe-dictionary-of-bavarian-dialects-in-austria) (Wörterbuch der historischen bairischen Mundarten in Österreich und Südtirol, WBÖ), the focus of his work lies in the continuation and reconception of this long running project. Besides lexicographic work, his research activities are dedicated to the variational linguistic analysis of the WBÖ data. In addition to this, he is working as a lecturer at the Department of German Philology at the University of Vienna.

He obtained his PhD in 2013 at the University of Freiburg (Germany) with a thesis on "Subjektive Dialekträume im alemannischen Dreiländereck" ("Subjective dialect areas in the Alemannic border triangle"), a study located in the field of folk dialectology. In the following years, he worked as a postdoc researcher at the University of Zurich in an interdisciplinary project (including the German department and the department of Geography) called [Modelling morphosyntactic area formation in Swiss German](https://www.spur.uzh.ch/en/research/associated/synmod2.html) (SynMod). The main goal of this project was to apply methods from GIScience to syntactic atlas data in order to test linguistic hypotheses and answer research questions, e.g. about different patterns of geographic distributions, dialect borders vs. transition zones etc.

His research interests include dialectology, sociolinguistics, lexicography, language change, language contact, syntax, folk linguistics, dialectometry, and GIS.
