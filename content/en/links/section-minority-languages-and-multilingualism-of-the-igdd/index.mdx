The “Minority Languages and Multilingualism” section of the International Society for the Dialectology of German (IGDD) focuses on varieties of German that exist in distinct linguistic and social contexts. At its core, it addresses German-based minority languages across the world and explores their development and research within the framework of close contact with other languages and cultures.
