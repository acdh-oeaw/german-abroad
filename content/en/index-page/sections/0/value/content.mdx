The conferences focus on systemic and sociolinguistic characteristics of German-speaking language minorities from the perspectives of variation linguistics, language contact and multilingualism research, as well as related disciplines. The focus is on language contact situations and phenomena as well as the multilingual communicative practices on which they are based, as they characterize German-speaking groups outside the German-speaking world. Perceptual perspectives such as language attitudes and language ideology with regard to contact varieties of German will also be addressed.

Parallel to the conference series, German Abroad also represents a global network of researchers working on the entire range of extraterritorial varieties of German. Interested researchers are always invited to get in touch with us, participate in the conferences and contribute to the networking of research in this field!
